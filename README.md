**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

For this project, I created an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game using advanced reinforcement learning techniques such as deep Q-learning. The given code was crucial as it contained classes for the game environment, including maze layout, pirate movement, awards, and game status. It also supplied a game experience class for storing episodes. An obstacle I encountered was incorporating the deep Q-learning algorithm into the Q-training algorithm part of the Jupyter Notebook. Training the pirate agent to navigate the maze and find the treasure was a challenging assignment. However, I successfully tackled it by analyzing the problem and implementing the strategies I acquired during the training.

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**

- **What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?** Computer scientists are crucial in resolving intricate issues using computational techniques and algorithms. Their work involves creating cutting-edge solutions significantly impacting diverse sectors such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, and software engineering. They achieve this by developing software, designing algorithms, and analyzing data. The abilities I acquired in this course, such as reinforcement learning and deep Q-learning, are essential to artificial intelligence. Computer scientists can utilize these skills to create intelligent agents capable of acquiring knowledge from their surroundings and making informed choices. This can lead to technological breakthroughs, increased efficiency, and overall quality of life.

- **How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?** As a computer scientist, I employ a systematic approach to problem-solving by decomposing complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. I then analyze these components for recurring patterns and devise optimized algorithms to address them effectively. I thoroughly evaluate my ideas' technical and ethical ramifications, ensuring they give the utmost importance to user privacy, fairness, and security. Through the application of computational thinking and problem-solving abilities, I cultivate methodical strategies to address difficulties and generate efficient solutions.

- **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?** My ethical obligations encompass guaranteeing the impartiality and openness of the intelligent agent's decision-making procedure, preventing biases in the training data, and safeguarding user data privacy. Additionally, I must evaluate the possible consequences of the agent's activities on the game world and the player experience, aiming to establish a constructive and pleasurable relationship while upholding integrity and justice. By emphasizing technological prowess and ethical deliberation, I strive to conscientiously contribute to computer science and devise solutions that constructively impact society.
